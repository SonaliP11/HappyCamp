## Purpose

The purpose of HappyCamp is to provide a comprehensive platform that enhances the after school activities experience for children, parents, and organizers. By leveraging innovative technology, we aim to streamline the management of activities, improve communication, and create an engaging and user-friendly environment for all users.

## Am I Responsive?

To ensure that HappyCamp is accessible on all devices, we have utilized the AmIResponsive tool. This tool allows us to preview how our website looks on different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a seamless user experience regardless of the device being used.

## Agile Methodology

Our project follows Agile methodology, which promotes iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility. This approach allows us to adapt to changes quickly and deliver incremental improvements.

## Project Board

We use a project board to track our progress and manage tasks efficiently. The board is divided into columns such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done," providing a clear visual representation of our workflow.

## UX Design

### Wireframes

### Typography

We have carefully selected typography that is both readable and visually appealing. The primary font used throughout the website is 'Roboto', which offers a clean and modern look. This font is complemented by 'Open Sans' for headings, providing a clear hierarchy and enhancing the overall user experience. Alkatra is used for heading.
